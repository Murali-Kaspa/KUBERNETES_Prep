1. What is Worker Nodes ?

A:  The Worked nodes are the servers (Vm's or Physical machines), Here the actual work done. it follow the instrcutions given by the master node.  
    These nodes host the pods that contain your containers.

2. What is Priority Class ? 

A:  PriorityClass tells Kubernetes which Pods are more important, but not where they should run.
    ex: if you have less CPU it will run only one POD, But the requirment is to run 3 PODs, So here priority comes the high priority POD will execute first and other goes to pending state.

3. What is DaemonSet in Nodes and why it is used ? 

A:  A DaemonSet creates one Pod per node, typically used to monitor, collect logs, or manage security on all Worker Nodes.
    This POD is independent. Whenever a new Node is created This DaemonSet will create a new POD in that node.
    This ensures that each node has a POD that will track those changes and send it to Control Plane.

4. What is NodeAffinity ? 

A:  It is similar to the NodeSelector Concept with more features, like it supports multiple Operators like : IN, NotIn, Exists, DoesNotExist, Gt & Lt.

SCENARIO QUESTIONS:

1. You have two worker nodes A and B, each node runs multiple pods and the CPU is reached it's peak value in both Nodes,
   So A new pod need to be deployed so you create a new NODE-C, So what happens to the old pods ?

A:  As Both nodes are full and a new node is created (Node-C), The new POD will be deployed in Node-C only, as it have the free CPU and Memory, 
    But the Exisiting pods in NODE-A,B are still running in the Same nodes. Kubernetes does not move existing Pods automatically to the new node.
    If u want to run it on the Node-C, you can delete some pods in nodes A nd B, So mostly it will create in Node-C.


2. What happens if your Worker Nodes are full, and a new POD is created ? 

A:  If you have a Worker Node and the CPU is full, Then the new PODS will not be created it is going to Pending state until it has free CPU.


3. I have 3 Applications to be deployed (micro,medium,large) and the worker nodes i have are (micro,medium,large),
   So how kubernetes know which pod deployed in which node based on their size ?

A:  In real cases we have worker nodes with diff diff sizes based on usage. 
    Testing Node has less CPU
    Production Node has more CPU.
    
    So, In this case we use NODE SELECTOR option. It is a mechanism used to control the placement of PODS onto specific nodes within a cluster. 
    we can attach appopriate labels to the pods, and in the POD specification file u can define a NodeSelector to match the desired labels.

    Labelling the nodes :         kubectl label node node-micro size=micro
                                  kubectl label node node-medium size=medium
                                  kubectl label node node-large size=large
       ex:   spec:
               containers:
                 - name: mypod
                   image: nginx
                 nodeSelector:
                   size: large
