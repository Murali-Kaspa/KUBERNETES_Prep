1. Understanding the Logic of HPA.

resources:
  limits:
    cpu: "256m"
    memory: "256Mi"
  requests:
    cpu: "200m"
    memory: "128Mi"

 - Question 1: What Happens if your cpu > 256m and the memory is < 256mi ?

So here the CPU utilisation is crossed it's threshold, the container may throttled so it slowdown the container but container was not deleted.
If we enable the HPA then a new container will be created and yes we have the old container as well, but it is slow. 

- Question 2: What Happens if your cpu < 256m and the memory is > 256mi ?

So as the POD memory is Full, it goes to OutOfMemory ERROR (CrashLoopBackOff may appear), So it deletes the pod and restarts the same pod. 
In this case it will not scale out it just restarts the same pod.

- Question 3: What is the purpose of requests ?

When HPA creates a new Pod, the Kubernetes Scheduler ensures that the target node has at least 200m CPU and 128Mi memory available, 
based on the Podâ€™s requests.

- Question 4: If you have 3 replicas and all are out of memory and CPU is beyond threshold, So is application accessible ?

No, As the PODS are continously killed and restared the same pods, the application will be un-available and it throws error like :502 (Bad Gateway) or 503 (Service Unavailable).
we have to manulayy increase the memory limit or enable vertical Pod scaling.
